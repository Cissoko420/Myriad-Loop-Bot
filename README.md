Development was almost finished until owner gave up on the idea.

Idea of the bot:

- Users get matched by rank, and need to Battle submitting their loop
- Judges will get notified in private chat once users submit their loop and need to cast vote
- Once vote threshold is met results come out and award winners updating their ranks.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Queue for battle using /battle, wait for another person to also queue for battle, then battle will start.
Submit loop using /submit <loopFile.mp3/wav>

After judges vote threshold is met, results come out for users to see. They get awarded points depending on rankings.
